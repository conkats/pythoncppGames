# cppGames
Repository to code some C++ games and learn while having fun

# Organization
To keep things organised we will make use of ***Milestones*** and break them down into small manageable tasks using ***Issues***.

***Milestones*** could be used as specific projects. For instance now that we decided to go ahead with the **PongGame**
we will define it as a ***Milestone*** in *GitHub*. And then we can break it down into smaller tasks as ***Issues*** than can be asigned to anybody.

We should create specific directory for each one of our projects.

# Current Project: **PongGame**

Create a simple 2-players Pong Game using C++ and SFML. For the project to be considered complete it should have the following:

- Frame with bouncing ball and two rectangles that can be move using specific keys for players A and B
- Window should include player's names and avatar and indicate the score of each player
- The game should reset every time one player scores
- The ball speed should increase every *N* rounds
- The game should finish for the best of *X* rounds
- classes should be use for balls and rectangles with appropriate functions to update their speed and position
- ***BONUS : *** *Game mode that allows to have two balls at once for increased difficulty*

# Notes, Objectives and Brain Storm
