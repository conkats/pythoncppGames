# cppGames
Repository to code some C++ and Python games and learn while having fun!

# Organization
To keep things organised we make use of ***Milestones*** and break them down into small manageable tasks using ***Issues***.

***Milestones*** could be used as specific projects. For instance now that we decided to go ahead with the **PongGame**
we will define it as a ***Milestone*** in *GitHub*. And then we can break it down into smaller tasks as ***Issues*** than can be asigned to anybody.

We should create specific directory for each one of our projects.

# First Project in C++: **PongGame**

Create a simple 2-players Pong Game using C++ and SFML. For the project to be considered complete it should have the following:

- Frame with bouncing ball and two rectangles that can be move using specific keys for players A and B
- Window should include player's names and avatar and indicate the score of each player
- The game should reset every time one player scores
- The ball speed should increase every *N* rounds
- The game should finish for the best of *X* rounds
- classes should be use for balls and rectangles with appropriate functions to update their speed and position
- ***BONUS : *** *Game mode that allows to have two balls at once for increased difficulty*

# Notes, Objectives and Brain Storm

Use `Note.txt` to write anything that might be important to remember

Use `Objectives` to set-up and update the short-, mid- and long-term objectives

Use `brainStorm` to be write and dream freely about a world without wars

# Python Projects: DinoGame
-  A dinosaur running in the desert (HINT: Similar to the one available from Google Brownser when there no network connection)
-  To run the python games you have to install the ursina module. 

All used assets (e.g. sprites, 3d objects) are in the assets folder. You can download simple the whole assets folder.

*Feel free to create or delete new files if needed*
