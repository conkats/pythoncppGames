Repository to code some C++ games and learn while having fun

2.- Clone the forked repo into your local machine
3.- Create your commits
4.- Submit your pull-requests


Organization:
1.- We should organize our work using "issues" to breakdown in small manageable 
tasks.
2.- We should create a specific directory for each sub-project (game). I don't
think it is necessary to create a repo for each game because we are just
starting so we can keep thing as simple as we can. Therefore, I created our
very first project directory named './blackBoxRedCircle/'
3.- I created a "objectives" file where we can set our short-, mid- and 
long-term objectives so we have path to walk through.
4.- I created a "brainStorm" file to add any thoughts about anything else.
